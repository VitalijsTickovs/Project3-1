History:
    - Created separate branch
    - Create separate virtual enviornment
    - Downloaded openVino

    - Found out that openVino is only for inference (i.e. running, but not training)
        - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY9nZbX1DWM)
        - Hence useful for running the model given a certain file of weights, but not for training
Ideas:
    - Get a pre-trained model for showcasing purposes then start building upon it in phase 2
        - Need to start exploring it and looking at its source code in phase 1 so I could get 
            straight to work and enchancements in phase 2
