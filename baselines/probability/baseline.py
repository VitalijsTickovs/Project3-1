# We know the active workers at any time
# We know the object(s) being interacted with through computer vision

# TODO : Come up with some initial knowledge base to make sure some actions will never be assigned to some objects
# no matter their probability (eg : you cannot "drink" a "crate"), will make the predict function more efficient (you can think of it as pruning)
# TODO : Make tests to optimize threshold
